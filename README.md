# Coach's Life Thoughts

I decided I wanted to start taking notes in the medium that I was most comfortable, markdown. It allows me to format my thoughts easily and in a way that feels satisfying. 

I've also wanted to start making structured notes on the things that I've read and contemplated, like studying. And the best way to do that, in my head is actually markdown, reason being is that I can easily re-order notes as I see fit as well as jot down notes/thoughts that need to be filled in later.
